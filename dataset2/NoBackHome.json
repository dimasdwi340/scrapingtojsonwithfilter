He was sitting inside the fort at Jaisalmer playing for tips. It left me wondering about his life. Who he is, where he came from and what his story is. I bet he could talk for hours!\n.\n.\n\u27a1\ufe0fDo you ever tip musicians on the street? \ud83c\udfbb\ud83c\udfb5 \u27a1\ufe0fWhat do you think of his tune?\n.\n.\nI never paid much attention to street performers until my son came along. He is always so entranced by them, he even talked of being a busker in London\u2019s underground during our visit there, that now I always pay special attention to them. .\n.\n.\n.\n.\n #storiesofindia #everydayindia #rajasthan #rajasthanistyle #indiablogtrain #india #incredibleindia #streetmarket #colorsofindia #indianlife #travelblogger #jaisalmer #streetphotographyindia\n#streetsofindia #indiaclicks #indiatravelgram #lonelyplanetindia #indiagram #dailylifeindia #indiatrains #luxurytrain #palaceonwheels #tbin #beautifulmatters #peopleofindia #humansofindia #TravelIndia #IncredibleiNDIA #IndiaTourism \n#Indiatravelgram @incredibleindia", "A beautiful morning ritual at the JW Marriott in Tucson.

Do we have this in the US?\n\nHere in Fiji this plant is used as a pain reliever for tooth aches. The root is boiled and then the water is strained out and swished around the mouth. #ciantravels #fiji #fijiforfamilies", "One of many odes to #target that my child has sung this morning. #dance moves", "Trying out Chinese today. #lovelanguages #nihao", "Happy New Year balloon drop for the kidz"]}]
