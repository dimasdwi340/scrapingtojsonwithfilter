Just said.. YES?\nThat was my last project in Santa Fe on assignment for @CapitalOne . Diving back into the culture, the food and the incredible nature New Mexico has to offer reminded me a lot of my childhood exploring this area. \nI was working on the launch of the new Venture X card that allows people to do what they love wherever and whenever that may be. For me it looked a bit like the REEL above. On location we enjoyed the milky way above Diablo Canyon, endless singletrack and an epic stay at Bishops Lodge to celebrate Venture X\u2019s 10X earn on hotels booked through Capital One Travel.\n\n#capitalonepartner", "\u2018The Long Traverse\u2019 - film premier ! monday ( tomorrow ) night at my studio in Pismo Beach, CA. \n\nCome and enjoy a night of film, food, drinks and raffle with a Q&A with US Olympian @christopherblevs & @dillon.osleger as they share their experiences exploring the Los Padres Wilderness on two wheels. \n\n$8 tickets at the door will go to support @sagetrailalliance in SB. \n\nsee you there!", "It\u2019s here.

Shot on location in Mallorca a few months back with Sony. It was a dream assignment to try and capture light in the Balearic Sea with a handful of incredible athletes. Working in these environments, especially when the moments are so finite with the weather, the light and the stamina - it reminds me what I love most about growing up as a sports photographer. I had seen this route years prior and dreamt of coming back and shooting it in perfect light. \n\n@sonyalpha \n\n@curtismorgan - Executive Producer\n@honngy - DP \n@mikeysandifer - Producer \n@rockandwatermallorca - Field \nProducer \n@davec9k - Editor\n@nuttynulty - AC\n@_ryanhill_ - Photo Assistant\n@ethan_pringle - Climber\n@margojain - Climber \n@sheneenagins - Climber", "The Long Way Around\n\nWhat we have here isn\u2019t your typical bike trip. Four close friends ventured into the great woods of the American west to experience the land via bike. Their original plans thwarted due to the devastation of wildfires that seemly strike the west more and more each year. With some last-minute rearranging of the route and a nod that it was safe, the ride was on!

We must always be engaged, at capacity. We fill in the empty spaces of our daily lives with the superficial.

We value the price of our lives as the time we spend instead of the time we save. \u00a0\n\u00a0\nTake the time to invest in the slowness around you.
