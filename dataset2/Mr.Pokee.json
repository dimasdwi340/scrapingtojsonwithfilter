Yes, it has. I mean we can go on walks and take spring photos - but we are in the middle of nowhere staying on a family farm at the moment and it\u2019s only just starting to bloom outside. Of course we can\u2019t travel right now but I think it also has a good side. \ud83c\udf38\u2800\n\u2800\nIt makes me appreciate the small things even more! Like a ladybug sitting on Audree\u2019s head or Herbee smelling a little flower. Or a tiny kiss between them every time they meet. It\u2019s not about traveling further and further anymore but feeling happy where we are. It\u2019s a great lesson! And it\u2019s great to see and share the positive in this. All these little things are right here in front of us, we just have to start noticing them. \ud83d\udc9b\u2800\n\u2800\nMusic by @lukegreenstone \ud83c\udfb5", "Happy Birthday, little Pokee \ud83e\udd94\ud83c\udf3b In honor of Pokee I would like to establish a little ritual for all of us to repeat on this day every year.
