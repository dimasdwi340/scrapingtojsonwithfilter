Hope you\u2019re all having a lovely wee Friday x", "I asked what you\u2019d like to see on my feed seeing as I can\u2019t travel at the moment. A few of you said, because I live by the sea, you\u2019d like too see more seaside stuff. So I\u2019m starting by reposting an old favourite of mine. A little different to the stuff I usually make so I hope you like it \ud83e\udd13", "Inspiration to make the house look extra special this Christmas came from @stgermainuk and @hedgesandflowers. They collaborated on an absolutely beautiful festive gift set, the Winter Bloom Bauble and Spritz Kit.\n\u2800\nYou get four gorgeous handmade glass baubles with real dried flowers inside (by the brilliant @hedgesandflowers), art-deco glasses, carafe, and jigger. The St-Germain bottle itself is the most handsome bottle in the history of handsome bottles.\n\u2800\n\u2800\nThe kits on hedgesandflowers.com are an absolute a steal at \u00a340 (I was going to buy a kit as a gift for my sister, but she saw this video and bought one for herself).\n\u2800\nAfter decorating the tree, I made myself a little St-Germain Spritz \u2013 that's St-Germain elderflower liqueur, prosecco, soda water, and a twist of lemon \u2013 the perfect Christmassy indulgence.", "(GIVEAWAY CLOSED) Sharing my favourite books of 2020 so far, and giving away a bundle of all of five! \ud83d\udcda\ud83d\ude01\n\u2800\nTo win, comment telling us which book you\u2019d take with you to a desert island. It can be any book, but you\u2019re only allowed one! I\u2019ll choose the winner at random on Monday.\n\u2800\nI never normally do videos like this. I take my hat off to the people who do it regularly... Talking to your own face on a phone screen is a real skill and really weird, especially when you go off on mad tangents about cherubs picking you up and flying you through the sky.  Time for a stiff drink...", "What\u2019s your favourite season? Mine is whichever season we\u2019re in right at the start of it, but toward the end I\u2019d always say autumn. It has rained all day here. Looking out the window, it doesn\u2019t look like the middle of summer. But I sort of like it, because I\u2019m at that point in the season where I start to look forward to the next one. I\u2019m pining after big jumpers and roaring fires and hearty stews. Anyone else the same?", "(Ad) When I first started out, I spent a year learning traditional photography. I loved working in the darkroom, seeing all these shapes and shadows gradually appear on the page, like they were moving, like magic. It was good to have a physical object to hold in my hand, to take that object home, put it up on the wall, and share it with people.\n\u2800\nThese days, I don't often get to hold physical copies of my work. But yesterday morning I opened a package from @inkifi_instagram. It was a dozen square prints of my photos and I felt the same buzz I felt all those years ago seeing my work in print for the first time. I must've looked at these photos hundreds of times on my phone and laptop, but looking at them in print was like seeing them fresh. I remembered all the details of the day: who I was with, where we were, what we were doing\u2026 how Lenny really hated that headdress and savagely chewed it to shreds seconds after the photo was taken.\n\u2800\nThat\u2019s what printing our photos does, I think: it brings memories to life, like magic. And now is a good time to bring a bit of magic into our homes.", "A load of accounts reposted this video of mine over the past few days, so I\u2019m reposting it here too... for the third time (#transparency). Sea what I did there? And there? Okay, that\u2019s enough. Stupid beach \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "I\u2019ve posted an essay of mine on my blog (link\u2019s in my bio). This is a little quote from the piece. The essay discusses the rise of @mrshinchhome and the subsequent debate surrounding her success; influencers and influencer marketing in depth; and how women are using Instagram and social media as a tool in the fight for equality. I\u2019ve been working on this bloody thing about six months. I\u2019ve poured my heart into it, so I\u2019d really love to know what you think. Saturday night... you all must be dying to read a 4000 word essay \ud83d\ude05", "My favourite thing about Instagram insights is the follower location. By city, most of my followers are in London, Hong Kong, Taipei, Paris and New York (in that order). How cool is that?! I\u2019m a total nerd for looking at maps, but I know there\u2019ll always be loads of places I\u2019ve never even heard of. Let\u2019s play a game: say hello and tell us where in the world you are right now! (*disclaimer: I\u2019m not currently sat on the beach with a mirror. I\u2019m at home in my big fluffy dressing gown with a cup of tea ready to say hello to you all \ud83d\udc40)"]}]
