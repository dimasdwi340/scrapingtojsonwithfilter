Operating on a 70-year-old wooden sailboat, the team gathers valuable information for both scientists and policy makers and seeks to spread awareness about marine life, plastic polution and the Ocean\u2019s health, with the aim of encouraging others to take action.\n\nI feel lucky and proud to be a part of this amazing group of people that want to learn from each other, inspire and take action when it comes to these issues.\u2028\u2028This wouldn\u2019t be possible without the passion-driven people behind the project; Belen, Daniel, Heimir and Charla that have all dedicated their lives to the oceans. \n\nWhile sailing around the coast of Iceland we witness the severity of the plastic pollution, which ranges from tiny micro-plastics in the ocean to large, abandoned fishing equipment on our beaches. It's everywhere. The scale of the problem is even larger than I would have imagined. \u2028\nThe oceans concerns all of us. It\u2019s important to Iceland with whales returning every summer to their main feeding ground. We are just a tiny part of nature. We belong to it, and we need to protect it \u2013 not exploit it. \u2028\u2028Filmed by the talented: @catkoppel \n\n#66North #GlacierFriday #OceanMissions @northsailing", "The drone we\u2019ve all been waiting for is out: DJI Mavic 3 \n\nI\u2019ve been travelling around the Alps, Dolomites and Iceland lately with this power drone in my backpack, and I can honestly say I\u2019m impressed. Incredible image quality, two lenses, 4k 120fps filming and 46 minutes of flight time. \n\nThe longer flight time has allowed me to reach places I otherwise couldn\u2019t with drones. This one will change the game for what\u2019s possible to capture with drones. \n\nIt has been so fun to be part of this launch and flying the Mavic 3. Well done @djiglobal on building the best drone I\u2019ve ever flown. It will join me on all my adventures from now on. \n\n #DJIMavic3 #ImagingAboveEverything", "with @xiaomi.global \u26f5\ufe0f I love sailing and the freedom it gives, so I set sails for a day in Croatia and brought the Xiaomi 11T Pro to capture it. \n\nThe camera in this phone is really amazing and I\u2019m so happy with the outcome of this film. \n\nIt captures the vibe of waking up next to the ocean and spending a day with wind in the sails. \n\nShooting in 4k 60fps, the Xiaomi is the perfect tool for shooting on the go and capturing great memories.\n#Xiaomi11TPro \u00a0#cinemagic #ad", "Yayy, it\u2019s out!

Because each time we come back, it feels like experiencing it for the first time all over again. \n\nThe video portrays the journey from the airport back to Ragnars home farm in Hali, the cute yellow house that I have good memories from. The drive there is incredible, where you\u2019ll pass waterfalls, glaciers and black sand beaches. I\u2019m Ragnars mind, that drive always gives him the feeling that he\u2019s finally home, so we wanted to capture that. \n\nI hope you enjoy and make sure to check out Ragnars music on Spotify and on his profile, for some more Icelandic music. \n\n\ud83d\ude0d\u2764\ufe0f", "I\u2019m bringing this amazing place to you \ud83d\ude0d Hopefully you can feel like you\u2019re with us for a moment \ud83d\udc9b\n\n#Iceland"]}]
