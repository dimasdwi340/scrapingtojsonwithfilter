Hawai'i has captured my heart ever since childhood when I'd go visit my family there. Each island is so different with unique adventures of the aquatic, jungly, and oftentimes rocky kind! Have you been before or are you itching to go? Today I'm reminiscing about L\u0101na\u02bbi one of the least-visited and most adventurous islands.

I brought along my niece and the hand sani. \u2063\n\u2063\nSo frankly before the \u2018Rona I rarely traveled with hand sanitizer and it wasn\u2019t until lately that I started looking into it more. There are times when running water just isn\u2019t available and lots of places ask us to sanitize before entering their establishments now, too!\n\u2063\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean I want chemicals and harsh perfumes on my skin. You too? We can all stop looking because I found the answer! @ecofreaks_usa has hand sanitizer that is unscented, leaves no residue, and is free from phthalates, parabens, and perfumes. Now if I enter an establishment and they want me to use hand sani, I\u2019ve got my own!\u2063\n\u2063\nThe company has also planted over 2k trees with One Tree Planted, are a WWF partner in conservation, and they offer large refills to cut down on single use plastics. If you dig that too you can get a discount on their website (link in bio) with the code TRAVEL20. Happy (cleaner) trails! #bringyourfreak #sponsored", "Baby blue water and white sand. #ad This is one of many perfect beaches in Aruba. And I love the contrast here. On one side of the island it\u2019s rugged, 4 x 4 territory and on the other it\u2019s white sand beaches and that perfect Caribbean blue water. \u2063\n\u2063\nThe last two times I visited I stayed in Palm Beach, where most of the high-rise hotels are. But this time I really wanted a smaller, boutique experience and Manchebo beach was perfect. No crowds, just perfectly quiet beach days. \n\nThe Manchebo Resort and Spa was perfect - with a truly amazing spa! I also love that they use paper straws and check out all those solar panels! #onehappyisland"]}]
