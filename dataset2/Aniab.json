          "Who's been re-watching their favorite 90s TV? 90210, Friends and Buffy have one thing in common: the forever recognizable style of the decade. My mum was never about the trends so, believe it or not, I\u2019m picking up butterfly clips for THE FIRST TIME IN MY LIFE!! As I was touching up my hair colour (every 8-10 weeks \ud83d\ude0b) + still using @Schwarzkopf Color Ultime (this time 3.8, aka Velvet Brown), I thought it would be fun to play with some shorter hairstyles that can work for everyone. Here are three easy ways to add some colour, fun and nostalgia to your everyday looks\u2026 Have fun! @shoppersbeauty @walmartcanada\n\u00a0\n#schwarzkopf_partner #colorultime #haircolour #90shair #hair #beauty #beautytips #hairtutorial #nostalgia",
          "#sponsored ice cream, popsicles and freezies are the diet when temps soar to 30+ and this summer has been treating us to some epic heat! We're turning this into a delicious opportunity and putting a twist on @kahlua #weekendcoffee with these popsicles and honestly I think this is some of my finest work. THESE. ARE. SO. GOOD!!! pro tip* leave the popsicles out for a few min or dip the mold into some hot water to loosen up the ice before pulling out your work so that you don't break them, you can always slide them back into the freezer on a plastic plate to prevent from melting further. BON APPETIT! visit kahlua.com for more tasty rcipies to transform your java into #WeekendCoffee!! https://lnk2.io/w7fFB87 *must be legal drinking age to enjoy*\n\n#food #popsicles #DIY #inthekitchen #heatwave #summertreats #icecream #coffee #butfirstcoffee #delicious",
          "#SimpliiPartner Things are looking different everywhere we go these days and it\u2019s never too late to start thinking ahead, and most importantly being ready for any contingency. I love fashion, it\u2019s my life, but we all know that one of the first places we can very easily save money is to curb our spending habits. This doesn\u2019t always mean you have to make giant sacrifices, in this video I\u2019m giving you some simple ways which you can start implementing into your own shopping rituals that are going to help you see that extra shirt you don\u2019t need as money in the bank! \n\n*watch till the end for some comic relief + an important PSA*\n\n#shopping #moneytalk #smartmoney #shoppingtips #howtosave #financeiscool #wearamask",

I LOVE LOVE LOVE that despite 2020 and with the help of amazing partners across the city they still managed go make it happen!

          "I have been finding it very therapeutic to use my hands these past few months. Finding DIY projects, cleaning, working out, cooking and baking. While doing our outdoor workouts looking at all the dandelions coming up everywhere I was reminded of when I was a little girl and my mum would fashion me flower crowns in the park. I never realized how easy they were to make until literally a week ago. Even with these yellow dandelion weeds these are giving me major summer feels. So even though festival season isn\u2019t coming back until next year I\u2019ll be over here getting in the spirit \ud83c\udf3c\n\n#friday #weekend #aniabinmotion #DIY #flowercrown #floral #howto #tutorial #flowercrowntutorial #summer #flowers #handmade #wianek #polishgirl #easterneuropean #polskadziewczyna",

          "Sitting down with a very special guest to debunk the myth that you need an accountant to do your taxes! ABSOLUTELY NOT TRUE! For a lot of us doing our taxes means just inputting the information from our T slips and sending them off, this takes under 30 min to do, think about the $$$ you will save on this DIY! And don't worry, we are keeping it short and sweet \ud83d\ude06\n\nThe tax FILING deadline is looming, with only a few weeks left to get it in ON TIME! late penalties are a waste of money and why would you want to do that to your future self. We have enough stresses to think about. And remember your balance is not due until SEPTEMBER so don't stress if you can't make the payment right away. \u2800\n\nWe have amazing tools at our disposal now to help us with the filing process, and services like SimpleTax (simpletax.ca) are not only letting you use their pay-what-you-want model (literally this also means $0) but now for every SimpleTax filer who pays any amount, they will donate a meal to Second Harvest to help Canadians in need, show me an accountant who will do the same \ud83e\uddd0\n\n#financeiscool #moneytalk #taxes #taxtalk #savings #tips #wfh #stayhome #accountant #accountig #finance #money #planningforthefuture #taxplanning #quadrantcharteredaccounants #charteredaccuntant #businessvaluator #taxman"
